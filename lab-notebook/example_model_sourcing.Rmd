```

```{r}
library(mrgsolve)
```

By sourcing the model file, the overseer model cache is pulled in and can 
be used directly. Since it handles everything relative to the Rscript in which 
is created, rather than where it is being sourced _from_, no changes have to be
made to how models are constructed, cached, etc.

```{r}
models <- source("../models/models.R")$value
```

```{r}
models$list_models()
```

```{r}
models$use("one_cmt_f") %>%
    ev(amt = 100) %>% mrgsim %>% plot
```
